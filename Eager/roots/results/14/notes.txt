* RI is sensitive to pattern anomalies (recurring anomalies). If some API call is consistently slow, RI can detect it.
* RI can also detect point anomalies, IF the anomaly occurred in a non-dominating API call.
* If a dominating API call becomes further slow, we can use percentile analysis.
* Percentile analysis is sensitive to point anomalies.
