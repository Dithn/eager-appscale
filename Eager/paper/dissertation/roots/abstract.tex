In this paper, we investigate Roots, a holistic 
application performance monitoring (APM) framework for 
performance anomaly detection and bottleneck identification 
in cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) systems.
Roots performs lightweight, full stack monitoring by integrating
the APM as a managed PaaS service.  By doing so, Roots is able to 
efficiently collect and correlate performance data across the PaaS stack,
precluding the need for application instrumentation.  Roots employs
a combination of statistical techniques that analyze this data to detect performance
anomalies (i.e. violations of service-level objectives). For each anomaly, 
Roots determines whether the event was caused by a change in 
the workload, and if not identifies the bottleneck component in the cloud platform
that is most likely to have degraded application performance. 
We implement Roots in the AppScale open source cloud platform, and evaluate its 
accuracy and overhead using PaaS-hosted web applications.
