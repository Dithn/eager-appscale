My sincere gratitude goes out to my advisors Chandra Krintz, Rich Wolski and Tevfik Bultan, whose guidance has been
immensely helpful to me during my time at graduate school. They are without a doubt three of the most well informed
and visionary scientists in the world, and I consider it both an honor and a privilege to have had the opportunity
to explore the uncharted seas of science under their tutelage. 

I also thank my wonderful parents, whose love and continued support have been the foundation of my
life. Thank you for the values you have instilled in me, and giving me courage to face all sorts of
intellectual and emotional challenges. 

I am also grateful to all my teachers and mentors from the past, who generously shared their knowledge
and experiences with me. My special thanks go out to Sanjiva Weerawarana whose intelligence
and leadership skills inspire me to be better at my work everyday. 

Finally, I thank the amazing faculty, staff and the community at UC Santa Barbara, whose smiles and 
positive attitude have made my life so much easier and exciting. I especially like to mention my colleagues
at the RACELab, both present and past, for all the intellectual stimulation as well as their warm sense of
friendship. 

Thank you, and Ayubowan!
