Cloud computing delivers IT infrastructure resources, programming platforms, and software
applications as shared utility services. Enterprises and developers increasingly deploy applications 
on cloud platforms due to the scalability, high availability and many other
productivity enhancing features of the cloud. Cloud-hosted applications 
depend on the core services provided
by the cloud platform for resources. In some cases they use the services provided by the cloud to implement most of
the application functionality as well (e.g. PaaS-hosted applications). 
Cloud-hosted applications are typically
accessed over the Internet, via the web APIs exposed by the applications.

As the applications hosted in cloud platforms continue to increase in number, the need for enforcing
governance on them becomes accentuated. We define governance as the mechanism by which the 
acceptable operational parameters are specified and maintained for a cloud-hosted application.
Governance enables specifying the acceptable
development standards and runtime parameters (performance, availability, security requirements etc.) 
for cloud-hosted applications as policies. Such
policies can then be enforced automatically at various stages of the application life-cycle. 
Governance further entails
monitoring cloud-hosted applications to ensure that they operate at a certain level of quality,
and taking corrective action when problems are detected. Through the steps of specification,
enforcement, monitoring and correction, governance can help resolve a number of prevalent issues in
today's cloud platforms. These issues include lack of good software engineering practices (code reuse,
dependency management, versioning etc), lack of performance SLAs for cloud-hosted applications,
and lack of performance debugging support. 

This proposal is aimed at exploring the feasibility of efficiently enforcing governance on cloud-hosted
applications, and evaluating the effectiveness of governance as a means of achieving administrative
conformance, developer best practices and performance objectives in the cloud. Considering the scale of
today's cloud platforms in terms of the number of users and the applications, 
we wish to automate much of the governance tasks through
automated analysis and diagnostics. To achieve efficiency, we put more emphasis on deployment-time
policy enforcement and non-invasive passive monitoring of cloud platforms, thereby keeping the 
governance overhead
to a minimum. We avoid run-time enforcement and invasive instrumentation of cloud applications 
as much as possible. We also focus on building governance systems that are deeply integrated with
the cloud platforms themselves. This enables using the existing scalability and high availability features of the cloud
to provide an efficient governance solution that can control all application events in a fine-grained
manner. Furthermore, such integrated solutions relieve the users from having to maintain and pay
for additional, external governance and monitoring solutions.

With the goal of efficient, integrated and automated governance for cloud-hosted applications in mind,
we propose the following three research goals.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design and implement a scalable, low-overhead governance framework for cloud platforms,
complete with a policy specification language and a policy engine. The governance framework should be
integrated into the cloud platforms, and must
strive to keep the runtime overhead of the user applications to a minimum while enforcing
common developer best practices and other organizational conventions.
\item Design and implement a methodology for formulating performance SLAs for cloud-hosted 
 web applications, without
 subjecting them to extensive performance testing or instrumentation. The formulated
 performance SLAs must be correct, tight and durable in the face of changing
 conditions of the cloud.
 \item Design and implement a scalable cloud application monitoring framework for detecting
application performance anomalies, SLA violations and diagnosing potential root causes. 
The framework should support collecting
 a wide range of performance and usage data from the user applications and the underlying cloud platform
 without instrumenting the user code, and without introducing significant runtime overheads.
 It should further facilitate employing a number of new and existing statistical methods
 and algorithms to analyze the gathered data in near realtime.
\end{enumerate}

We design and implement EAGER~\cite{6903538, eager-fop15} as a means of 
achieving the first goal. EAGER is a lightweight
governance framework built into PaaS clouds. It supports defining policies using a simple syntax
based on the popular Python programming language. EAGER promotes deployment-time
policy enforcement, where policies are enforced on user applications (and APIs) every time
an application is uploaded to the cloud. By carrying out policy validations at
application deployment-time, and refusing to deploy applications that violate policies,
 we provide fail-fast semantics which ensure that deployed applications are fully policy compliant. 
EAGER architecture also provides the necessary provisions for facilitating run-time policy
enforcement (through an API gateway proxy) if necessary. Our experimental results show
that EAGER validation and policy enforcement overhead is very small, and it scales well to
handle thousands of user applications and policies. Overall, we show that integrated governance
for cloud-hosted applications is not only feasible, but also can be implemented with very
little overhead and effort.

To achieve the second goal of formulating performance SLAs, we design and implement 
Cerebro~\cite{Jayathilaka:2015:RTS:2806777.2806842} --
a system that can predict bounds on the response time of web applications developed for PaaS clouds.
Cerebro is able to analyze a given web application, and determine a bound on its response time without
subjecting the application to any testing or runtime instrumentation. This is achieved by a mechanism
that combines static analysis of application source code with runtime monitoring of the underlying
cloud platform (PaaS SDK to be specific). Cerebro is fast, can be invoked at the deployment-time 
of an application, and does not require any human input or intervention. 
The bounds predicted by Cerebro can be used as statistical guarantees (with well defined correctness
probabilities) to form performance SLAs. Cerebro's SLA prediction capability, coupled with a policy
enforcement framework such as EAGER, can facilitate specification and enforcement of performance-related
policies for cloud-hosted applications. We implement Cerebro for Google App Engine public cloud
and AppScale private cloud. Our experiments with real world PaaS applications show that Cerebro
is able to determine accurate performance SLAs that closely reflect the actual response time
of the applications. Furthermore, we show that Cerebro predicted SLAs are not easily affected by
the dynamic nature of the cloud platform, and they remain valid for long durations. More specifically, 
Cerebro predictions remain correct for more than 12 days on average~\cite{7396174}. 

Finally, we design and implement Roots to address our third goal. Roots is a performance monitoring and root
cause analysis system built into PaaS clouds. It collects data from all the different layers of the
PaaS stack -- from load balancers to low level PaaS kernel service implementations. However,
it does so efficiently, without instrumenting user code and without introducing a significant
overhead to the application request processing flow. Data gathered at different layers can
be correlated easily thereby enabling tracing of application requests through the PaaS stack.
Roots is also extensible in the sense that 
any number of statistical analysis methods can be incorporated into Roots for performance
anomaly detection and diagnosis. Furthermore, it facilitates configuring monitoring requirements
at the granularity of user applications, thereby allowing different applications to be monitored
and analyzed differently. Roots also supports executing multiple different analysis methods on the same
application concurrently. When an anomaly has been detected, Roots is able to determine if
the anomaly was caused by a change in the application workload or due to a performance 
bug in one of the underlying PaaS kernel services. A low overhead, integrated, full stack monitoring
framework of this nature is a novel contribution in the cloud space (especially with respect
to PaaS clouds, which abstract out many runtime details from the user). 

We have already made much progress with respect to the first and second goals discussed above.
We have implemented significant parts of EAGER and Cerebro, and demonstrated various results
and contributions in our past work. Roots is largely an ongoing project, and much of its implementation
and experimentation is left for future work. We plan to get an initial set of results on Roots out
by the Fall of 2016. Then we plan on working towards consolidating all our research contributions
into a single thesis focused on governance for cloud-hosted applications, and defending it
by the end of 2016.
