In this paper, we describe EAGER, a model and a software architecture that 
facilitates API governance as a cloud-native feature. EAGER supports comprehensive policy
enforcement, dependency management, and a variety of other deployment-time API
governance features. It promotes many software development and maintenance
best practices including versioning, code reuse and retaining API backwards
compatibility. EAGER also includes a language based on Python that enables
creating, debugging and maintaining API policies in a simple and intuitive
manner. EAGER can be integrated into cloud platforms that are used to host APIs
to automate governance tasks that otherwise require custom code or developer intervention.

Our empirical results (gathered using a prototype of EAGER developed for AppScale)
show that EAGER adds negligibly small overhead to the cloud application 
deployment process, and the overhead grows linearly
with the number of APIs deployed. We also show that EAGER scales well 
to handle tens of thousands of APIs and hundreds of policies. 
Our future work considers static and dynamic analysis
that automates detection of API specifications and dependencies, that employ 
analysis and policies for automatic test generation for web APIs, and that 
combine deployment-time and run-time governance capabilities at scale.
