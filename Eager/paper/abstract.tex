Web services and cloud computing have
revolutionized the way software is developed and maintained. As a consequence we see
a significant uptake in using web application programming interfaces (web APIs) to develop
new applications, and a huge increase in interest towards deploying applications in the cloud
with their own web APIs. These trends pose new software maintenance and
evolution challenges that require powerful API governance techniques that are
built into the cloud platforms as cloud-native features. Without such tightly integrated 
and enforced governance methods, API providers and consumers have to deal with
many potential software maintenance issues such as poorly developed
code going into production unchecked, API changes breaking existing 
applications and applications taking dependencies on unverified and untested APIs.

We propose EAGER, a model and an architecture that extends existing cloud platforms
to provide enforced API governance at a fundamental level. EAGER can check for and
prevent backward incompatible API changes from being rolled out into the cloud. EAGER
also enforces code reuse and a variety of other software maintenance best practices
via its comprehensive policy enforcement support. We implement EAGER for an open source
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud and demonstrate its feasibility, efficiency, scalability and
effectiveness as an API governance enforcer for clouds.
