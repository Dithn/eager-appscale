Web services and cloud computing have
revolutionized the way software is developed and maintained. More and
more applications are developed based on web application programming interfaces 
(web APIs), and more and more web APIs are deployed in the cloud to facilitate the 
development of new applications. This trend poses new software maintenance and
evolution challenges that require powerful API governance techniques that are
built into the cloud platforms as cloud-native features. Without such tightly integrated 
and enforced governance methods, API providers and consumers have to deal with
many potential software maintenance issues such as poorly developed
code going into production unchecked, API changes breaking existing 
applications and applications taking dependencies on unverified and untested APIs.

We propose EAGER, a model and an architecture that extends existing cloud platforms
to provide enforced API governance at a fundamental level. EAGER can check for and
prevent backward incompatible API changes from being rolled out into the cloud. EAGER
also enforces code reuse and a variety of other software maintenance best practices
via its comprehensive policy enforcement support. We implement EAGER for an open source
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud and demonstrate its feasibility, effectiveness as a
governance enforcer for clouds, efficiency and scalability.
