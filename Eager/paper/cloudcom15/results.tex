Now we present the results obtained from the experiment described in the previous section. We 
analyze the number of SLA renegotiations performed by each API consumer during the 112 day
period of the experiment, and calculate a set of cumulative distribution functions (CDF). These
CDFs describe the probability of finding an API consumer that experienced a given number of
renegotiation events. Figure 1 illustrates the resulting CDFs.

According to Figure 1, the largest number of SLA renegotiations experienced by any user is 6. This is
with regard to the StudentInfo\#addStudent operation. In all web APIs, at least 95\% of the API
consumers experience no more than 4 renegotiation events during the period of 112 days. Further,
at least 75\% of the API consumers see no more than 3 SLA renegotiations. These statistics
indicate that SLAs predicted by Cerebro for the Google App Engine environment are fairly
stable over time, and renegotiation is required only rarely. From an API consumer's perspective
this is a highly desirable property, since it reduces the frequency and the overhead of SLA renegotiation.

Next we analyze the time duration between SLA renegotiation events. For this we combine the SLA validity
periods computed for each API consumer into a single statistical distribution. 
Table 1 shows the 5th percentile, mean and 95th percentile of these combined distributions. The smallest
mean SLA validity period observed in our experiments is 296.44 hours (12.35 days). This value is given by the
Rooms\#getRoomsInCity operation. 
This implies that on average, API consumers do not have to renegotiate Cerebro-predicted SLAs
for at least 12.35 days.
The smallest 5th percentile value of 0.05 hours is shown by
the StudentInfo\#addStudent operation, but this appears to be a special case compared to the other web API
operations. The second smallest 5th percentile value of 7.65 hours is shown by the 
StudentInfo\#deleteStudent operation. Therefore, ignoring the StudentInfo\#addStudent operation, API
consumers observe SLA validity periods longer than 7.65 hours at least 95\% of the time. That is, the time
between SLA renegotiations is greater than 7.65 hours at least 95\% of the time.
