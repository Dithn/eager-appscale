Our research builds upon advances in the areas of SOA governance and
service management. 
Guan et al introduced FASWSM~\cite{1607141} a web service management
framework for application servers. FASWSM uses an adaptation technique that
wraps web services in a way so they can be managed by the underlying
application server platform. Wu et al introduced DART-Man~\cite{1504267} a web
service management system based on semantic web concepts.  Zhu and Wang
proposed a model that uses Hadoop and HBase to store web service metadata and
process them to implement a variety of management functions~\cite{5959326}.
Our work is different 
from these past approaches in that EAGER targets policy \textit{enforcement} 
and we focus on doing so by extending extant
cloud platforms (e.g. PaaS) to provide an integrated and scalable governance
solution.

Lin et al proposed a service management system for clouds that monitors all
service interactions via special ``hooks'' that are connected to the
cloud-hosted services~\cite{5616981}. These hooks monitor and record service
invocations, and also provide an interface so that the individual service
artifacts can be managed remotely. However, this system only supports run-time
service management and provides no support for deployment-time policy checking
and enforcement.  Kikuchi and Aoki~\cite{6525502} proposed a technique
based on model checking to evaluate the operational vulnerabilities and fault
propagation patterns in cloud services. However, this system provides no
active monitoring or enforcement functionality.
Sun et al proposed a reference architecture for monitoring and managing cloud
services~\cite{5579654}. This too lacks deployment-time governance, policy
validation support, and the ability to intercept and act upon API calls which
limits its use as a comprehensive governance solution for clouds.

Other researchers have shown that policies can be
used to perform a wide range of governance tasks for SOA as access
control~\cite{4279630,5713420}, fault diagnosis~\cite{6154236},
customization~\cite{4027138},
composition~\cite{1592403,Erradi:2006:PMS:1515984.1515990} and
management~\cite{Suleiman:2009:IUM:1564601.1564730,6481237,4028029}. We build
upon the foundation of these past efforts and use policies to govern
RESTful web APIs deployed in cloud settings. 
Our work is also different it that it provides a 
unifying policy language that employs a simple, developer-friendly syntax
based upon the Python language (vs XML), which can be
used to specify a wide range of governance requirements.

Peng, Lui and Chen showed that
the major concerns associated with SOA governance 
involve retaining the high reliability of services, recording how many services
are available on the platform to serve, and making sure all the available 
services are operating within an acceptable service
level~\cite{4730489}. EAGER attempts to satisfy similar requirements for 
modern RESTful web APIs deployed in cloud environments. 
However, EAGER's Metadata Manager and ADP record and track of all deployed APIs 
in a simple, extensible, and comprehensive manner.  Moreover, EAGER's policy
validation, dependency management, and API change management features 
``fail fast'' to detect violations immediately making
diagnosis and remediation less complex, and prevent
the system from ever entering a non-compliant state.
