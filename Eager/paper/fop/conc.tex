In this paper, we describe EAGER, a model and a software architecture that 
facilitates deployment-time API governance as a cloud-native feature. EAGER supports comprehensive policy
enforcement, dependency management, and a variety of other deployment-time API
governance features.
Our empirical results 
show that EAGER adds negligibly small overhead to the cloud application 
deployment process, and the overhead grows linearly
with the number of APIs deployed.
Our future work considers static and dynamic analysis
that automates detection of API specifications and dependencies.
