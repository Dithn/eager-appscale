The key intuition behind Roots is that
the cloud platform can aid the developer in anomaly detection and root cause analysis.
The cloud platform has full visibility into all the activities that occur in various layers of the cloud,
including all invocations of the PaaS kernel services. Therefore
it can automatically collect data regarding events that are related to application request processing. 
The cloud platform can then process the collected data offline (but in near realtime) to detect 
performance anomalies and identify root causes.

We argue that data collection can be implemented efficiently in the cloud platform so as to not
introduce a significant overhead to deployed applications.
Moreover, data collection can be always active in the cloud thus relieving the application developers
from having to instrument their code, or setting up external monitoring.
The data processing can benefit from the vast amount of compute
resources available in the cloud platform. The offline processing ensures that application request
processing is not impacted by monitoring, and the near realtime analysis ensures that developers
and other interested parties are notified of performance anomalies urgently.
