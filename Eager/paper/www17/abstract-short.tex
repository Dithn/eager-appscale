In this paper we describe Roots -- a system for automatically identifying the
``root cause'' of performance faults in Platform-as-a-service (Paas)
web service applications.  Roots does not require
application-level instrumentation.  Instead, it tracks events within the PaaS
platform that are triggered by a request to the application using a
combination of metadata injection and platform-level instrumentation only.

We describe the extensible Roots architecture, a prototype implementation 
of the system, and a statistical methodology for performance fault
root cause identification and analysis.  We evaluate the efficacy of the
prototype using a set of PaaS-hosted web services and detail the performance
overhead and scalability of the implementation.
