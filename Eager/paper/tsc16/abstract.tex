In this paper, we investigate Roots, a holistic 
system for application performance monitoring (APM), 
performance anomaly detection, and root cause bottleneck identification 
in cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) systems.
Roots performs lightweight, full stack monitoring by integrating
the APM as a managed PaaS service.  By doing so, Roots is able to 
efficiently collect and correlate performance data across the PaaS stack,
precluding the need for application instrumentation.  Roots employs
a combination of statistical techniques that analyze this data to detect
changes in workload (i.e. a service-level objective violation) and, for 
anomalies not due to a workload increase, to identify the PaaS component
that is most likely to have degraded application performance. 
We implement Roots in the AppScale open source cloud platform and evaluate its 
accuracy and overhead using PaaS-hosted web applications.
