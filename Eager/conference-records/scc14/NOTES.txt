Day 1
=====

ICWS - WIP Session 1,2

* Beijing central heat system
  - Heat sensors deployed in user's homes
  - Central service gathers temperature readings and regulates heat distribution throughout the city
  - Use of business processes to receive/process maintenance requests, billing etc.

* WSDarwin
  - Proxy service for many different versions of a web API
  - Client talks to the proxy and Darwin adapts the request to the current version of the web API
  - Implemented for Axis2; case study using EC2

* JSON web service testing
  - github.com/aherranz/jsongen.git

BigData - WIP Session 3

* CouchFS
  - File system on top of CouchDB
  - Use Hadoop to create indexes and process queries etc.

Cloud - WIP Session 4,5

* Hardware device (security element) for storing API keys securely
  - Tamper proof (2 factor authentication: card + PIN)
  - Currently there are no standards for web applications to access local resources (e.g. access card) securely
  - Currently applications integrate with the device using proprietary drivers/plug-ins
  - Efforts to standardize this integration is currently underway (W3C working group)

* Benchmark results for compute and storage optimized EC2 instances
  - Preliminary results show that compute optimized instances provide slightly better IO performance
  - Only compared 2 specific types of instances (one from each category)
  - Didn't benchmark across different OS's and file system implementations
  - Variability of the results not shown/discussed

Day 2
=====

* LinkedIn community for Services Computing

Keynote: Crowds & Clouds
  - Initial crowdsourcing solutions attempt to model crowds as a DB extension (e.g. CrowdDB)
  - Use of ontologies, declarative query languages (e.g. SPARQL) and fact sets (historical data, survey results etc.)
  - Can we trust the crowds? Need provenance
  - A W3C standard is being developed to address provenance (called PROV)
  - Provenance algebra (Green et al, PODS 2007, VLDB 2007)

Cloud - I&A Session 1

SCC - I&A Session 2

* Rain4Service
  - USDL: upcoming standard for describing heterogeneous services (SOAP, REST, human-provided);
  - USDL covers all aspects of a service from pricing to legal
  - Interesting approach for load balancing requests in a service composition
  - Based on physics of rain drops rolling down a surface

* NevCan (http://sensor.nevada.edu/NCCP/Climate%20Monitoring/Network.aspx)
  - Weather monitoring sensors 
  - Data collected by a Arduino/CR1000 device
  - Arduino device forwards data to a RESTful web service
  - Data stored in a DB

* CLAMS
  - Cross-layer (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and cross-vendor cloud monitoring
  - Monitoring agents deployed at each cloud vendor, at each layer that need to be monitored
  - Data collected and processed at a separate central cloud
  - Use a pull model to get data (Monitoring manager queries remote agents)
  - Uses SNMP to collect data

SCC - Research Session 3

* DATAVIEW
  - Dataflow system for processing bigdata in the cloud
  - Allows users to create workflows using a drag-n-drop editor and run them in the cloud
  - Runs on multiple IaaS insfrastructures (EC2, Euca etc)
  - Provides estimates on running time and cost before starting a job (WIP)
 
SCC - I&A Session 4


Day 3
=====

ICWS - Research Session 5

Cloud - Research Session 6

SCC - Research Session 7

realtime bigdata analytics - ParStream, 


Day 4
=====

ICWS - I&A 8

ICWS - Research Session 9

* Service evolution patterns
  - Formal model for reasoning about service evolution
  - Changes coule be on operations or data types (add, remove, refine etc.)
  - Patterns: a catalog of reusable patterns to handle certain service evolution scenarios
    + Compatibility pattern (evolve a service without impacting consumers)
    + Transition pattern (evolve with minimal impact)
    + Split-map pattern

SCC - Research Session 10

Day 5
=====

BigData - Research Session 8

* DeltaDB
  - DB for storing server/process monitoring data over time
  - Log structured (stores only the changes/deltas)
  - Significant reduction in storage space
  - Powerful analytics and query support (compatible with MapReduce)

SCC - A&I Session 12


Day 6
=====

ICWS - A&I Session 15 (Katmai)

* Web service performance functions

* Reliability prediction of web service compositions

SCC - A&I Session 23

* Performance antipattern detection in cloud (static analysis) 

SCC - A&I Session 24  (Dillingham) [Porting Effort]

SCC - A&I Session 17

SCC - A&I Session 18
